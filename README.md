# Text Trim NPM Package

I created this package because I found myself needing to trim text frequently and using the .concat function to add "..." to the end of text stings for posts, blogs etc within my fullstack applications.
Rather than repeatedly making the same helper function for each project, I decided to make this npm package to save my time and hopefully others too.

### This package does the following
This package will turn:
`Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur aliquet quam id dui posuere blandit. Curabitur`

to a length of your choosing for example 20 characters:
`Lorem ipsum dolor si...`
